## Context
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. 
This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.
## Objective:
The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans
